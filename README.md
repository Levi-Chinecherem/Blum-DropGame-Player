## FAQs

### Will I be banned for using this script?
While BlumBot interacts with the game interface just like a human would, I cannot guarantee there will be no repercussions from the Blum development team. Hereâ€™s what you should know:
- Unlike other bots, BlumBot **does not** interact with Blum's API. It performs casual left-clicks on the in-game stars, simulating user behavior.
- I **cannot** provide any guarantees regarding penalties from the Blum developers, as I am not affiliated with them.
- However, the script is designed to be **programmatically untraceable**. This means Blum developers should not be able to distinguish its behavior from that of a real human player.

### Discussion of Updates
The recent updates to the BlumBot enhance user experience by allowing for a more streamlined and automated gameplay process. By prompting users for the number of game loops and facilitating a smooth transition between games, the script reduces the need for constant user input, making it easier to enjoy multiple rounds of the game. 

Furthermore, the detection mechanism for the end of each game and the wait for manual confirmation to continue ensures that the user retains control, while still benefiting from automation. These improvements not only simplify the gameplay process but also align with the goal of mimicking human behavior, potentially reducing any risks associated with using automation tools.
